# Harvard-CYO---Bank-Data-Set
This is the final project for the Harvard Data Science Certification where I focus on a classification algorithm for the bank marketing data set

he submission for the choose-your-own project will be three files: a report in the form of both a PDF document and Rmd file and the R script that performs your machine learning task. You must also provide access to your dataset, either through automatic download in your script or inclusion in a GitHub repository. (Remember, you are strongly discouraged from using well-known datasets, particularly ones that have been used as examples in previous courses or are similar to them. Also remember that you may not submit the same project for both the MovieLens and Choose Your Own project submissions.) We recommend submitting a link to a GitHub repository with these three files and your dataset. Your grade for the project will be based on your report and your script.

Report and Script
Your report and script will be graded by your peers, based on a rubric defined by the course staff, as well as by the course staff. The staff grade will be your final grade for the project. Note that due to the volume of submissions and the number of graders, it can take up to four weeks to receive your staff grade, although we strive for a faster turnaround time! To receive your grade, you must review and grade the reports of five of your fellow learners after submitting your own. This will give you the chance to learn from your peers. You are encouraged to give your peers thoughful and specific feedback on their projects.

Please pay attention to the due dates listed! The project submission is due before the end of the course to allow time for peer grading. Also note that you must grade the reports of your peers by the course close date in order to receive your grade.

Honor Code
You are welcome to discuss your project with others, but all submitted work must be your own. Your participation in this course is governed by the terms of the edX Honor Code. If your report is found to violate the terms of the honor code (for example, if you copy a project from another learner), you will receive a zero on the project, may be unenrolled from the course, and will not be eligible to receive a certificate.

Project Due Date
Submissions for the project are due one week before course close, on June 23, 2021, at 23:59 UTC. This allows time for peer grading to occur! Peer grades are due at course close, on June 30, 2021, at 23:59 UTC.

Grading Rubric
Note: after you submit your project, please check immediately after submitting to make sure that all files were correctly uploaded. Occasionally, there are file upload failures, and it's easiest to fix if these are caught early.

Files (5 points possible)
The appropriate files are submitted in the correct formats: a report in both PDF and Rmd format and an R script in R format. The PDF version of the report should be knit from your Rmd file, and the R script should contain all of the code and comments for your project.

0 points: No files provided
3 points: At least one file is missing and/or not in the correct format
5 points: All 3 files were submitted in the requested formats
Report (25 points possible)
The report documents the analysis and presents the findings, along with supporting statistics and figures. In order to demonstrate your understanding of course material, please provide thorough explanation or justification for various steps of your project, such as why a specific train/test split (e.g. 50/50 vs 90/10) or algorithm was used. The report must be written in English and uploaded. The report should assume that the reader is not familiar with the project or the dataset. The report must include at least the following sections:

An introduction/overview/executive summary section that describes the dataset and variables, and summarizes the goal of the project and key steps that were performed.
A methods/analysis section that explains the process and techniques used, including data cleaning, data exploration and visualization, any insights gained, and your modeling approach. At least two different models or algorithms must be used, with at least one being more advanced than linear or logistic regression for prediction problems.
A results section that presents the modeling results and discusses the model performance.
A conclusion section that gives a brief summary of the report, its potential impact, its limitations, and future work.
0 points: The report is either not uploaded or contains very minimal information OR the report appears to violate the terms of the edX Honor Code.
5 points: One or more required sections of the report are missing.
10 points: The report includes all required sections, but the report is significantly difficult to follow or missing significant supporting detail in multiple sections.
15 points: The report includes all required sections, but the report is difficult to follow or missing supporting detail in one section (or has minor flaws in multiple sections).
20 points: The report includes all required sections and is easy to follow, but with minor flaws in one section.
25 points: The report includes all required sections, is easy to follow with good supporting detail throughout, and is insightful and innovative.
Code (20 points)
The code in the R script should run without errors and should be well-commented and easy to follow. It should also use relative file paths and automatically install missing packages. The dataset you use should either be automatically downloaded by your code or provided in your GitHub repo along with the rest of your files (Rmd, PDF, R). If your dataset is provided as a zip file in GitHub, your code should automatically unzip and load it. The R script should contain all of the code and comments for your project.

0 points: Code does not run and produces many errors OR code appears to violate the terms of the edX Honor Code.
5 points: Code runs but does not produce output consistent with what is presented in the report OR there is overtraining (the test set is used for training steps).
10 points: Code runs but is difficult to follow and/or may not produce output entirely consistent with what is presented in the report.
15 points: Code runs, can be followed, is at least mostly consistent with the report, but is lacking (sufficient) comments and explanation OR uses absolute paths instead of relative paths OR does not automatically install missing packages External link OR does not provide easy access to the dataset (either via automatic download or inclusion in a GitHub repository).
20 points: Code runs easily, is easy to follow, is consistent with the report, and is well-commented. All file paths are relative and missing packages are automatically installed External link with if(!require) statements.
Have a question about the choose your own project? Want to bounce some ideas for an analysis to do or a dataset to pick off someone else? Need some feedback on the best approach to take or some troubleshooting for a snippet of your code? You can ask your questions here!

You are encouraged to discuss general approaches to your project. It is okay to post small snippets of code if you're having trouble getting a particular piece of code to run. However, you may not post your entire R script for the project.
